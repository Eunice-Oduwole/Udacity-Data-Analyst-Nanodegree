# TMDB-movies
## by Eunice Oduwole

## Introduction 
In this project, we are going to look into a data set which contains about 10,000 movies gathered from the Movie Database (TMDb), it includes 21 columns such as cast, director, budget, revenue and ratings etc.

To explore the data set, we aim at providing answers to the following questions;

- What type of movies are being produced over the years?
- What kind of properties are associated with movies that high revenues?
- Do movies with less runtime recieve higher vote?
- Is a type (genre) of movie associated with runtime?

Dataset can be found [here](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/October/59dd1c4c_tmdb-movies/tmdb-movies.csv)





## Summary of Findings
The result of this project revealed that as time evolve, some type of generes are been produced than others such as; **Drama, Comedy, Thriller and Action**. It was seen that movies with higher runtime recieves a higher vote. And also, I discovered that on average movies with higher revenues have a budget 7.449737e+07, runtime of 115.61 and vote_average of 6.39

Limitations: The conclusions were made on a smaller dataset due to the fact that a larger percentage of data had no information on budget and revenue. Filling them with the mean could make our results bias and to avoid this, they dropped.
